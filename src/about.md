I'm Jessica Lord. Really, [another site is my real site](http://jlord.us), but I'm having fun with this one. Here's a page for the [books I read in 2019](/books).

I'm web developer, team lead (at [Glitch](https://glitch.com), where this site lives!), urban designer, history and language nerd. I live in New York City.

## Corners of the internet

I can be found to varying degrees in these places:
